# anypoint-icons

A set of Anypoint icons to be used in web components.

Include library into the document / element:
```
<link rel="import" href="../anypoint-icons/anypoint-icons.html">
```

To use an icon from this set you should prefix `iron-icon` with the `anypoint`, followed by a colon, ":", and then the icon id.

```
<iron-icon icon="anypoint:application"></iron-icon>
```
